# calculator

Developed a calculator web application hosted on GitHub using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application highlights an engaging user interface, with advanced functionalities such as past calculation logging and the integration of the Desmos API for graphing functions.

The calculator supports a comprehensive range of mathematical operations including square roots, exponents, decimals, sign inversion, and fundamental arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

Furthermore, the HTML and CSS implementation ensures a responsive design that optimizes user interaction across various devices, enhancing the overall user experience.

Notable features of the application include a logging mechanism that records each equation following evaluation, allowing for convenient referencing of up to five past calculations. To facilitate an efficient workflow, the application incorporates a backspace button for correcting individual character errors and a clear button for removing all calculations.

The Desmos API augments the user experience by providing an input field and graphing functionality, both powered by the API.

To underscore code modularity, the codebase incorporates multiple helper functions that streamline value display, evaluation, and deletion operations based on user input. This design approach enhances code readability and facilitates future maintenance.

Anticipating future enhancements, the application's architecture is designed with flexibility in mind. Additional features, such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more, can be seamlessly incorporated with minor adjustments to the existing codebase.
